# HBTU MUN 2018

Just an event I judged and managed on request.

## Technology

Basically a simple [react](https://reactjs.org/) site. Built using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) though.

Deployed with the excellent [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Acknowledgments

Apart from the tech stack authors, this was bootstrapped via this [gatsby starter](https://github.com/ChangoMan/gatsby-starter-dimension).
